# 🏥 Cancer Hospital Readmission Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis on Patient Data

### 📘 Overview
This project explores patient data from a cancer hospital to identify key factors contributing to hospital readmissions.  
The analysis focuses on understanding patient demographics, comorbidities, and hospitalization trends using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques in Python.

---

### 🎯 Objective
To analyze patient records and uncover patterns that can help reduce hospital readmission rates and improve patient outcomes.

---

### 🧠 Key Questions Addressed
- What are the primary causes or factors associated with hospital readmissions?
- How do demographic factors such as age and gender influence readmission rates?
- What trends are visible in length of stay, diagnosis, and discharge outcomes?
- Can specific patient groups be identified as high-risk for readmission?

### 📊 Project Workflow
1. **Data Import & Cleaning**  
   - Loaded dataset and handled missing or inconsistent values.  
   - Renamed columns and standardized data types for analysis.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Descriptive statistics to understand dataset structure.  
   - Visualized distributions for age, gender, LOS, diagnosis, and outcomes.  
   - Correlation analysis to identify significant variables.  

3. **Insights & Observations**  
   - Patients with multiple comorbidities had higher readmission risk.  
   - Certain diagnoses showed significantly higher LOS and readmission rates.  
   - Readmission trends were more pronounced in older age groups.  

4. **Recommendations**  
   - Targeted care management for high-risk patients.  
   - Improve discharge planning and follow-up scheduling.  
   - Use predictive analytics in the future to anticipate readmissions.

### 📈 Sample Visualizations
- Distribution of readmitted vs non-readmitted patients  
- Correlation heatmap of clinical variables  
- Average length of stay by diagnosis  
- Gender-based readmission comparison

### 🩺 Future Improvements
- Apply **logistic regression or random forest** to predict readmissions.  
- Incorporate **clinical notes** or **EHR data** for deeper insights.  
- Build an **interactive dashboard** using Tableau or Power BI.
